      Design System
    </h3>
    <p>
      In order to effectively address the complexity of the product, it was important to design a system with user-friendly navigation. While considering the main feature and solution of the product, we also placed a significant emphasis on building a highly scalable system. This approach allows for easy integration of future additions and enhancements, ultimately enabling the product to achieve its intended business objectives while providing a satisfactory solution for the user.
      To initiate the design process, we first established a style guide that included a color system, typography system, and spacing system. This served as a foundation for determining the components that would be utilized in the final application. By starting with these fundamental elements, we were able to create a cohesive and intuitive design that effectively balances functionality with user-friendliness. Overall, our goal was to create a streamlined and efficient system that is both easy to use and scalable for future growth.
