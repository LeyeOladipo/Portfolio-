      UNDERSTANDING THE USER    
    </h2>
    <p>
      Based on this research, we understand that the main need of these students is to find an easy and convenient way to access healthy meals that fit their schedule. They are likely looking for an app that can help them discover food options near them, as well as plan and prepare their meals in advance. These users may also be interested in finding ways to save time and money on their meals, as they may have limited resources due to their student status.
      To better serve these users, the Foodie app could include features such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A directory of food options in the user's area, including restaurants, cafes, and grocery stores
      </li>
      <li>
        A meal planning and grocery list feature to help users plan and prepare their meals in advance
      </li>
      <li>
        Integration with delivery and pickup services to make it easy for users to access food options without having to leave their location
      </li>
      <li>
        Customization options to allow users to filter their food search based on factors such as dietary preferences, budget, and location
      </li>   
      <li>
        Tips and resources for budget-friendly meal planning and preparation to help users make the most of their resources.
      </li>

      PROJECT OVERVIEW
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The Problem
    </h3>
    <p>
      A larger population of students and young adults hardly have the time to cook meals of late. Most thrive in obtaining food from restaurants all around them.
    </p>
    <h3>
      The Goal    
    </h3>
    <p>
      Design a mobile application called Foodie! This encourages users to get the food of their choosing from any restaurant around them in the comfort of their homes, workplace or classroom.    
    </p>
    <h3>
      The Problem Statement    
    </h3>
    <p>
      Tioluwanimi is a Dramatic Art student who’s longing to satisfy her craving wherever she can get it. From past experience, she’d usually be too busy with classes and ends up going to bed with either an empty stomach or a bowl of cereal.
    </p>
    <h3>
      The Solution    
    </h3>
    <p>
      Foodie! Is a regional online restaurant that helps connect foodies to whatever restaurant around them. With the help of a mobile app and fast connection with dispatch riders within Nigeria, now we can get your meal to you faster and safer.

        TIME:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Users usually do not have enough time to cook or go shopping to prepare a meal.      
      </p><br>
      <h3>
        ACCESSIBILITY:      
      </h3>
      <p>
        Users are unable to track the delivery process of their meals especially the fact that they cannot see how long the food would take to cook.      
      </p><br>
      <h3>
        VARIETY:      
      </h3>
      <p>
        Users in most cases have to settle for meals that do not suit their preferences.

    <p>
      After conducting an interview and creating empathy maps, we came to an understanding of the needs of the users. 
      During the course of the research, we identified a group of users to be students who have no time in preparing their own meals.
